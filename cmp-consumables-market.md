<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMP Consumables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CMP Slurries</li><li>CMP Pads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CMP (Chemical Mechanical Planarization) consumables market comprises two main types, namely CMP slurries and CMP pads. CMP slurries are abrasive fluids used in the polishing process to remove excess material from the surfaces of semiconductor wafers. They typically contain abrasives, chemicals, and additives tailored for specific polishing needs. On the other hand, CMP pads are soft materials with a textured surface used in conjunction with slurries to evenly distribute abrasive particles and minimize scratching on the wafer's surface. Both CMP slurries and CMP pads play crucial roles in achieving high-precision and defect-free wafer planarization in semiconductor manufacturing.</p></p>
