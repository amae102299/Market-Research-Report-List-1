Growing awareness and acceptance of ART procedures, along with increasing public and private funding, have also contributed to the market's growth.</p><p>Furthermore, the trend of delayed motherhood and the rising trend of same-sex couples and single women opting for parenthood through IVF have further fueled the demand for donor egg IVF treatment. Advancements in techniques, such as pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS) and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), have also gained popularity in the market, as they offer enhanced success rates and reduce the risk of chromosomal abnormalities.</p><p>According to the forecast period analysis, the donor egg IVF treatment market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.7%. This growth can be attributed to factors such as increasing infertility rates, rising acceptance of ART procedures, and advancements in reproductive technologies.
