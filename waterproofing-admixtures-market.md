<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Waterproofing Admixtures Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crystalline Type</li><li>Pore Blocking Type</li><li>Other Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Waterproofing admixtures are materials added to concrete or mortar mixtures to enhance their water resistance properties. Crystalline type admixtures consist of materials that react chemically with water and form insoluble crystals, thus blocking the pores and making the mixture impermeable to water. Pore blocking type admixtures create a hydrophobic layer on the surface, preventing the penetration of water. Other types of admixtures include water-repellent admixtures, which reduce surface tension and increase the mixture's water resistance. These admixtures are essential in construction to protect structures from water damage and ensure their longevity.</p></p>
