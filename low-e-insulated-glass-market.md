<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low-E Insulated Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hard Coated</li><li>Soft Coated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Low-E insulated glass is a type of energy-efficient glazing used in windows and doors. It reduces heat transfer and improves insulation. There are two types of Low-E glass: hard coated and soft coated. Hard coated Low-E glass has a layer of tin oxide applied during glass manufacturing, making it more durable but less efficient. Soft coated Low-E glass, on the other hand, has a thin layer of metallic coating applied after manufacturing, providing better energy efficiency. Both types help to improve energy savings and create a comfortable indoor environment.</p></p>
