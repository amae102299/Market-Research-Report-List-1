<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Degradable Mulch Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Starch-based</li><li>Starch Blend with PLA</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Degradable mulch film is a type of agricultural film used to cover soil in order to improve crop growth and control weed growth. There are two main types of degradable mulch films: starch-based and starch blend with PLA. Starch-based films are primarily made from corn or potato starch and are designed to degrade naturally over time, leaving no residue behind. Starch blend with PLA films, on the other hand, are a combination of starch and polylactic acid (PLA) and offer improved mechanical properties and flexibility. Both types of films provide sustainable alternatives to traditional plastic mulch films.</p></p>
