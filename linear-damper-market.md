<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Damper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adjustable Linear Damper</li><li>Non-adjustable Linear Damper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The linear damper market consists of two primary types: adjustable linear dampers and non-adjustable linear dampers. Adjustable linear dampers are designed with the ability to modify their performance by altering various parameters such as stiffness, damping force, and velocity sensitivity. These dampers provide flexibility in adjusting the desired level of damping based on specific requirements. On the other hand, non-adjustable linear dampers lack this feature and operate at a fixed damping capacity throughout their lifespan. Both types are utilized in various industries to control and dampen vibrations, shocks, and movements.</p></p>
