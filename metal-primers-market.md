<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Primers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Iron Oxide Primer</li><li>Zinc Chromate Primer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metal primers are coating products that are specifically designed to adhere to metal surfaces and provide a protective layer before the application of the final paint. Iron oxide primers are commonly used and offer excellent corrosion resistance due to the iron oxide pigments used in their formulation. On the other hand, zinc chromate primers contain zinc chromate pigments, providing superior anti-corrosive properties, making them suitable for highly corrosive environments. Both primers ensure enhanced durability and longevity of the painted metal surfaces, protecting them from rust and degradation.</p></p>
