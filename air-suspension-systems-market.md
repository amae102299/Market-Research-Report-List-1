<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Suspension Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electronically Controlled</li><li>Non-Electronically Controlled</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Air suspension systems can be classified into two types: electronically controlled and non-electronically controlled. Electronically controlled air suspension systems use sensors and electronic control units to monitor and adjust the air pressure in the suspension system. This type of system provides a more precise and responsive control of the suspension, allowing for better ride comfort and handling. On the other hand, non-electronically controlled air suspension systems rely on mechanical components to regulate the air pressure, resulting in a less advanced and less adjustable suspension system.</p></p>
