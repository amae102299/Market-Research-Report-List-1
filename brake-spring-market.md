<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brake Spring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Progressive Spring</li><li>Linear Spring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The brake spring market consists of two main types: progressive spring and linear spring. Progressive springs are characterized by a variable spring rate, meaning that as the brake pedal is pressed further, the resistance progressively increases. This type of spring offers enhanced control and responsiveness in braking systems. On the other hand, linear springs have a consistent spring rate throughout the compression process, providing a more consistent and predictable braking experience. Both types serve as crucial components in various braking systems, catering to different needs and preferences.</p></p>
