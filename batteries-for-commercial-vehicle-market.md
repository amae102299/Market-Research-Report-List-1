<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Batteries for Commercial Vehicle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flooded Lead-acid Batteries</li><li>Absorbent Glass Mat Batteries</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Batteries for commercial vehicles can be classified into two main types: Flooded Lead-acid Batteries and Absorbent Glass Mat (AGM) Batteries. Flooded Lead-acid Batteries are the commonly used and cost-effective option. They have liquid electrolyte and require regular maintenance to ensure proper water levels. On the other hand, AGM Batteries are a more advanced option with a glass mat separator that absorbs the electrolyte, making them spill-proof and maintenance-free. AGM Batteries are more expensive but offer higher performance and longer lifespan.</p></p>
