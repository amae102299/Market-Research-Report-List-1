<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The V-Notch Segment Ball Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flanged</li><li>Flangeless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>V-Notch Segment Ball Valves are commonly available in two types: Flanged and Flangeless. </p><p>In the Flanged market, these valves are designed with flanges on both ends, allowing them to be easily connected to pipes with the help of bolts. Flanged valves are commonly used in applications where a secure and leak-proof connection is required.</p><p>On the other hand, Flangeless valves lack flanges and are directly connected to pipes using welding or other suitable methods. They are preferred in applications where a compact and space-saving design is needed or in situations where flanged connections are not feasible.</p><p>Both types of valves serve the same purpose of regulating flow, but their connection methods differ, providing users with options based on specific requirements.</p></p>
