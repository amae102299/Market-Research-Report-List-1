<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bias Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>General Bias Tire</li><li>Bias Belted Tire</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Bias tires are a type of tire construction where the tire plies are aligned diagonally to the centerline of the tire. General bias tires have multiple layers of ply cords, creating a stiff tire structure suitable for heavy-duty applications. They offer good durability but have lower efficiency and a rougher ride. On the other hand, bias belted tires have additional belts placed diagonally under the tread, providing improved stability and handling. They offer a more comfortable ride but are less durable than general bias tires.</p></p>
