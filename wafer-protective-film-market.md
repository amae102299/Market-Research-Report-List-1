<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer Protective Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>UV Curing Type</li><li>Non-UV Curing Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wafer protective film market is categorized into two types: UV curing type and non-UV curing type. UV curing type films are coated on wafers and then cured using UV radiation to form a protective layer. They offer advantages such as fast curing speed and superior adhesion. On the other hand, non-UV curing type films do not require UV radiation for curing and are typically self-adhesive or thermally cured. They are known for their easy application and removal, making them suitable for industries where UV radiation is not preferred.</p></p>
