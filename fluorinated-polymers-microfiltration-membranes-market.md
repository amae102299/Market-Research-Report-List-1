<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluorinated Polymers Microfiltration Membranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cross Flow</li><li>Direct Flow</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fluorinated polymers microfiltration membranes are used for various filtration applications. Two common types of filtration in this market are cross flow and direct flow. In cross flow, the feed solution is passed tangentially across the membrane surface, creating a sweeping action that helps to prevent clogging and prolongs membrane life. Direct flow, on the other hand, involves the feed solution flowing directly through the membrane without any sweeping action. Both types have their own advantages and are used depending on the specific filtration requirements of the application.</p></p>
