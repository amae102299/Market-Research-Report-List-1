<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Perfluoroethane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Purity:0.95</li><li>Purity:0.9</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Perfluoroethane market consists of two types based on purity - Purity: 0.95 and Purity: 0.9. Purity: 0.95 denotes Perfluoroethane with a purity level of 95%, meaning it contains 95% pure Perfluoroethane and 5% impurities. This type is considered of higher quality and is often used in applications where purity is crucial. On the other hand, Purity: 0.9 signifies Perfluoroethane with a purity level of 90%, meaning it contains 90% pure Perfluoroethane and 10% impurities. This type is relatively less pure and finds applications in environments where a slightly lower purity requirement is acceptable.</p></p>
