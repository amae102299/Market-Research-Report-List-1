<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Auto dimming rearview mirrors are a type of automotive technology that automatically adjusts the mirror's brightness to reduce glare from headlights of vehicles behind. There are two main types: Inside auto dimming rearview mirrors and outer auto dimming rearview mirrors. Inside auto dimming mirrors use sensors placed on the inside of the windshield to detect glare and dim the mirror. Outer auto dimming mirrors, on the other hand, have sensors integrated into the mirror itself to detect glare. Both types provide enhanced visibility and safety while driving at night or in bright conditions.</p></p>
