<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy Truck Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The heavy truck tire market can be classified into two main types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires are constructed with reinforcing steel belts that run perpendicular to the tread, providing stability and flexibility. They offer better fuel efficiency, improved traction, and greater resistance to heat build-up. On the other hand, bias tires are constructed using multiple layers of overlapping synthetic or natural fiber cords, resulting in a more rigid structure. Although bias tires are less expensive, they offer less fuel efficiency and have lower traction and heat resistance compared to radial tires.</p></p>
