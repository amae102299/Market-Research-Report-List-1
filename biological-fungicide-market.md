<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biological Fungicide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Microbial</li><li>Botanical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biological fungicide market consists of two major types: microbial and botanical. Microbial fungicides contain living microorganisms, such as bacteria or fungi, that directly combat plant pathogens. They release enzymes or toxins to control fungal growth. Botanical fungicides, on the other hand, are derived from plants and typically contain natural compounds that have antifungal properties. These fungicides work by disrupting the metabolic pathways or cell walls of fungal pathogens. Both microbial and botanical fungicides offer environmentally-friendly alternatives to conventional chemical fungicides, promoting sustainable and eco-friendly agricultural practices.</p></p>
