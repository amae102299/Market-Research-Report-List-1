<p><ul><li>Oligomers</li><li>Monomers</li><li>Photoinitiators</li><li>Additives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Free Radical Light Curing Resin refers to a type of resin that cures under the influence of light. It is comprised of four main components: oligomers, monomers, photoinitiators, and additives. Oligomers are short polymers that provide the resin with strength and flexibility. Monomers are smaller molecules that promote the curing process. Photoinitiators are compounds that, upon exposure to light, initiate the reaction that leads to resin curing. Additives are substances added to enhance certain properties of the resin, such as viscosity, color, or adhesion.</p></p>
