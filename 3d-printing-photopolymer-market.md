<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Printing Photopolymer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ultraviolet</li><li>Visible</li><li>Infrared</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The 3D printing market for photopolymers can be categorized into three types based on the wavelength of light used for curing: ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR). UV photopolymers utilize a shorter wavelength of light, offering fast and precise printing with high resolution. Visible light photopolymers use a wider wavelength spectrum, enabling a balance between speed and resolution. IR photopolymers employ longer wavelengths, which allow for deeper curing in thicker prints but may sacrifice some resolution. These distinctions in wavelength result in different capabilities and trade-offs in the 3D printing process.</p></p>
