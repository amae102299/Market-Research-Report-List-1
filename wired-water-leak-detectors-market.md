<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wired Water Leak Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Leak Detector</li><li>Active Leak Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wired water leak detectors market consists of two types: passive leak detectors and active leak detectors. Passive leak detectors are devices that trigger an alarm or alert when they come into contact with water. These detectors are typically placed in areas prone to water leaks, such as basement floors or near water heaters. Active leak detectors, on the other hand, actively monitor water flow and pressure in plumbing systems. They can detect abnormal water flow or pressure changes, indicating a potential leak or pipe burst. Both types of detectors are essential for preventing water damage and potential flooding in buildings.</p></p>
