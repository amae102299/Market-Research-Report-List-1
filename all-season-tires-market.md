<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The All-season Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Studded Type</li><li>Studless Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>All-season tires are categorized into two types: studded and studless. Studded tires have metal studs embedded in the tread, providing better traction on icy and snowy roads. They grip onto the surface, preventing sliding. However, they can damage road surfaces and are often prohibited in some areas due to their disruptive noise.
