<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nonablative Laser Resurfacing Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonablative Fractionated Lasers</li><li>Nonablative Nonfractionated Lasers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nonablative laser resurfacing device market can be classified into two main types: nonablative fractionated lasers and nonablative nonfractionated lasers. Nonablative fractionated lasers involve delivering multiple microscopic laser beams to the skin, creating tiny holes while leaving the surrounding skin intact. This promotes collagen production and skin rejuvenation. Nonablative nonfractionated lasers, on the other hand, deliver a larger laser beam that heats the deeper layers of the skin without damaging the surface. Both types aim to improve the appearance of skin without the need for downtime or invasive procedures.</p></p>
