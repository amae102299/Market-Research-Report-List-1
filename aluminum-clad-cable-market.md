<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum-clad Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Smooth Metallic Sheath</li><li>Corrugated Metallic Sheath</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The aluminum-clad cable market can be categorized into three main types: smooth metallic sheath, corrugated metallic sheath, and other markets. Smooth metallic sheath refers to a type of cable construction where the aluminum conductors are enclosed in a smooth metal casing, providing durability and protection against external elements. Corrugated metallic sheath, on the other hand, involves a cable design where the aluminum conductors are encased in a corrugated metal sheath, offering enhanced flexibility and resistance to bending. Lastly, the category of "other markets" includes any additional segments within the aluminum-clad cable industry that do not fall under the smooth or corrugated sheath types.</p></p>
