<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The OLED ITO Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>8-11 ohms/sq</li><li>18-20 ohms/sq</li><li>90-100 ohms/sq</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The OLED ITO Glass market can be categorized into different types based on the sheet resistance values. The types include 8-11 ohms/sq, 18-20 ohms/sq, 90-100 ohms/sq, and Others (which are generally in the range of 50-200 ohms/sq). These values represent the sheet resistance of the Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) coating on the glass. Lower resistance values, such as 8-11 ohms/sq, indicate better electrical conductivity, making them ideal for high-performance OLED displays. On the other hand, higher resistance values, like 90-100 ohms/sq, are suitable for applications where lower costs are favored over optimal electrical properties. The Others market refers to types that fall outside the specified ranges.</p></p>
